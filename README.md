## Welcome to my personal website!

I built it from scratch with love. Still needs work, but hey what's new.


If you're on the jekyll branch and want to see what I've been up to...

&nbsp;

You need to install ruby and Jekyll!

**ASIDE** -> If you're on a Mac, you need to make sure you have your command tools updated:

```xcode-select --install```

Then install ruby:

```brew install ruby```

Then you can use the ruby package manager *gems* to install jekyll: 

```brew install jekyll bundler```

Now you can 'run the site'

            cd myblog/
            bundle exec jekyll serve

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000]("http://localhost:4000")
