# Welcome to my personal website!

I built it from scratch with a lot of love. I'm still working out the kinks, but hey what's new?

I'm hoping to have a tutorial working out how to do all of this stuff with Github pages. This all just vanilla html, css, but I'm gonna try to use some bootstrap or something with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
