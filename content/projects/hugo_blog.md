# I created this blog in 2018

I wanted to create the fastest website ever.

I built the first iteration of this site in 2018. Golang was one of the hot new languages on the scene, and Hugo was one of the few Go based frameworks for building new sites.

I built this site from scratch, no theme, just hugo templating coupled with one stylesheet and some assets that I had commissioned.

Hugo was (and still is) an incredible Static Site generator that can compile markdown files at "blazingly fast" speeds. I still think it's a powerful framework for building websites.

However, I've realized over the yearsâ€“I don't have to sacrifice speed, for flexbility and developer experience. If I want to continue practicing React and play with new tools I can do that too. Hugo is a great tool for building blogs and static content, but I wanna try the new thing out, and it works and is fast and accessible who cares??

There are internal users and external users and we must not forget either.

I'm currently re-creating this site in NextJS. Stay tuned for the redesign!
