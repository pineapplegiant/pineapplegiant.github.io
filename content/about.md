## Background

In the summer of 2018, I graduated from the University of South Florida with a bachelors in Humanities and Chemical Engineering.
Junior year, I realized my passions for software while in "Numerical Methods" (A programming ChemeE class that was required for the major). By that time, it was already too late to change majors. The class taught the Matlab programming language. Even though Matlab is lame, learning how to program felt was not, and it felt like learning how to do magic (it still does).

In November 2019, I enrolled into a B.S in Computer Science at Oregon State University. During my tenure I interned at Intel and then Workiva working as a Software Engineer. I wrote mostly file system scripts in Python at Intel and Javascript at Workiva.

From 2020-2023 I got a job as a Front End Engineer at Searchspring. There, I used used Angular, React, and Searchspring's SDK (snap) to implement Searchspring's relevancy and merchandising product onto customer's ecommerce site.

I enjoy both coding and art. And I aspire to make sure every line of software I write makes the world a better place. Super corny right?

## Interests

When I'm not coding, you'll find me making pizza or going to the gym to burn off the calories‚Äìto eat more pizza. I absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è Hawaiian pizza hence the alias üçç"pineapplegiant". I also like to learn about philosophy, psychology, and am passionate about mental health and wellbeing. I also love playing music and shooting film photography. I hope to blog about all of the things here soon.

Thanks for coming to my personal site, if you wanna chat don't be shy.

Also one last note, this website is coded all from scratch with a lot of love, using CSS grid and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so it sucks & breaks on IE. Feel free to look at the source code for this website; I try to write good comments where I can.
