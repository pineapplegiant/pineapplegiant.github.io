## Background

Hiya my name's Guillermo but my friends call me "G-mo".

In the summer of 2018, I graduated from the University of South Florida with a bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering and Humanities.

Towards the end of undegrad I realized my passions for software. It was while taking "Numerical Methods" (A programming ChemeE class that was required for the major) where I learned Matlab my first "official" programming language. However, by that time, it was already too late to change majors. Even though Matlab is lame, learning how to program was not. Programming felt like learning magic (and it still does).

In November 2019, I enrolled into a B.S in Computer Science at Oregon State University. During my tenure I interned at Intel and then Workiva working as a Software Engineer. I wrote mostly file system scripts in Python at Intel and Javascript at Workiva.

From 2020-2023 I worked a as a Front End Engineer at Searchspring. There, I used used Angular, React, and Searchspring's SDK (snap) to implement Searchspring's relevancy and merchandising product onto customer's ecommerce sites.

I enjoy both coding and art. And I aspire to make sure every line of software I write makes the world a better place. Super corny right?

## Interests

When I'm not coding, you'll find me making pizza or going to the gym to burn off the calories‚Äìto eat more pizza. I absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è Hawaiian pizza hence the alias üçç"pineapplegiant". I also love to learn about philosophy, psychology, and am passionate about mental health. I love playing music and shooting film photography too. I hope to blog about all of the things and post more of my work here soon.

Thanks for coming to my personal site, if you wanna chat don't be shy.

Also one last note, this website is coded all from scratch with a lot of love, using CSS grid and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so it sucks & breaks on IE. Feel free to look at the source code for this website; I try to write good comments where I can.
