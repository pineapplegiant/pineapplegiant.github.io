## Background

In the summer of 2018, I graduated from the University of South Florida with a bachelors in Humanities and Chemical Engineering.  

Junior year, I realized my passions for software while in "Numerical Methods" (A chemeE class that was required for the major). But by that time, it was already too late to change majors. The class taught the Matlab programming language. Even though Matlab sucks, learning how to program felt like learning how to do magic. It still does.

In November 2019, I enrolled into a B.S in Computer Science at Oregon State University. Now, I aspire to be a software engineer (hopefully soon ðŸ˜…). I love to code and I hope the software I write will do good in the world. Super corny right?

##  Interests

When I'm not coding, you'll find me cooking or at the gym. I absolutely love *hawaiian pizza* hence the alias "pineapplegiant" (yes pineapple goes on pizza). I like to read too, but I find it hard to sit down in one place for too long these days. As far as hobbies go, I also love playing music and have been getting into film photography. I hope to blog about all of the things here soon.

Thanks for coming to my personal site, if you wanna chat don't be shy.

Also one last note, this website is coded all from scratch with a lot of love, using CSS grid, so don't crucify me if it sucks.
