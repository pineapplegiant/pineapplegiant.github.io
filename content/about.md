Hi my name's Guillermo, but my friends call me "G-mo".

I was born and raised in Orlando Florida, and went to college at USF (University of South Florida) in Tampa. In 2018 I graduated USF with a dual bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering and Humanities.

Towards the end of my double degree, I discovered my true passion for software and programming while taking "Numerical Methods" (a computational class that was required for the major). We were learning the Matlab programming language, and even though I think Matlab is gross now, I was hooked! Learning how to program felt like learning magic (and it still does).

In November of 2019, I enrolled in a B.S in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I then interned at Intel and Workiva as a Software Engineer. At Intel I wrote file system scripts in Python, lots of documentation and created many tests using Pytest. At Workiva, I wrote some Javascript, got to create developer tools and tutorials for onboarding-I also got to use Docker and Kubernetes in a professional setting for the first time.

From 2020 - 2023 I went on to work as a Front End Implementation Engineer at Searchspring. There, I used [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and Searchspring's SDK ([snap](https://searchspring.github.io/snap/#/)) to implement Searchspring's relevancy and merchandising product.  The product was pretty cool, and I learned a lot about ecommerce and the needs of shop owners. At Searchspring I also learned the beauties of SASS, how to debug web applications, and discovered the horrors of working with other people's code. I also managed a lot of accounts, held a lot of meetings with customers, and learned how to work with lots and lots of (difficult) people who don't know what they want yet like to complain :').

## Interests

I enjoy coding! I love art. I love to work with people. I try to make every line of software and every interaction I have with people make the world a better place.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me making pizza or going to the gym so I can be hungrier to eat more pizza. I absolutely ‚ù§Ô∏è Hawaiian pizza hence the alias üçç"pineapplegiant". I also love to learn about philosophy, psychology, and am passionate about mental health and meditation. I love playing music and shooting portraits on film as well. I hope to blog about all of the things, post more of my work, and live-stream one day soon.

Thanks for coming to my personal site, if you wanna chat don't be shy.

Currently, the site is hand-coded using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and CSS Grid so it won't look correctly on IE (which has luckily been deprecated). Feel free to look at the source code for this website; I try to write good comments where I can. I'm hoping to migrate to NextJS, TailwindCSS, and Vercel in the coming months.
