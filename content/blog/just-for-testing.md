## There's nothing here

Your probably on this page wondering to yourself *why*? 

Well you're not alone.


You see, I've been working on this site for way too damn long.

Too damn long I tell ya. So I, just gotta publish it. I'm gonna fix it though. There's a lot that needs to be done.


Things that I need to do:

1. Fix the blog list page huge ass footer.
2. Fix the header link not highlighting while in a blog post.
3. Add Taxonomies for the blog list page & the projects list page.
4. Fix the mysterious border bottom line in the header on the about page on mobile.
5. Make this actual blog page not look like shit, but like an actual blog.
6. Make the dates work on the list page.
7. Buy a box of tissues to wipe away the teers.
8. Get a job.
9. Start acting like a goddamn adult.
