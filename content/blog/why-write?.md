In an age where things are becoming increasingly visual, dynamic, more stimulating even, why write? Aren't there better mediums to express oneself? I mean if we're talking in the realm of pure rhetoric; wouldn't you prefer to watch a movie over reading 1,000 pages of text? Wouldn't it be more exciting to hear a Hans Zimmer score layered over skillfully crafted visual effects than just a long stagnant passage of text? Wouldn't it be better to admire the incredible acting abilities of Keanu Reeves or connect with thoughtful lyrics of John Lennon.

I often ask my self these kinds of questions. Especially in the back of my head when I tell people, "Yeah I want to start a blog and write stuff. Most of the time people's responses are very nonchalant. I wonder what they really think. Maybe they think: "Oh, that sounds lame" or probably "Good for you dude". See, that's cool and all but it doesn't really help me answer the question, or does anything to dispute the value of writing in todays society.


> Why write?


Well, I have a few answers. 

The first of which is pretty simple. **I like to write**. Wow. What a concept. Some people like weird shit, I think writing is pretty tame in the realm of human expression look up train surfing or competitive [dog grooming](https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bizarre-hobbies-muppet-dog.jpg). 

Secondly, **I think I'm pretty good at writing**. No, I'm no Hemingway (maybe one day though?). That's not the point anyway. It's about creating the best content I can and creating good content at that. And this ties into the questions I've asked above. Would you prefer to watch something over reading it? Well if it's a shit Youtube tutorial over a well-written article well then, no. Just like any book to movie adaption, aren't the books usually better? You can't generalize a whole medium and I'm not attempting at doing that either, but there are levels of quality in everything. And when you're _really_ good at something I think all people can appreciate the quality of the work regardless of what it _is_. So in that way I shouldn't have to worry so much about rhetoric, or attracting the largest of crowds or whatever. As long as I'm fucking good at what I do, people will read what I write. An example of admiring quality, would be appreciating the hot steamy beauty of [Jake Gyllenhal](https://www.hollywoodpicture.net/100-top-best-jake-gyllenhaal-handsome-photos-wallpapers-hd-collection/7080/) you don't gotta be attracted to men to know the man oozes sex-appeal. C'mon just look at that face.

And my third answer is a bit more philosophical. **Writing is the closest medium to human thought**. Let's unpack this. We generally think in words. In this way, writing is the most intimate form of communication. When you read the words I write, you're literally reading a stamp of my consciousness printed onto your screen. You're connecting with the very essence of my self, or performed self, or whatever, but we won't get into that here. It's the closest embodied essence after just actually talking to me in person or maybe probing my brain with some brain reading device. And when I inevitably perish into the dark abyss that is the void of death, future humans or (aliens?) can read the words that I have eloquently typed and "connect with me" long after I'm gone. Thus words forever immortalize myself and what I've tried to communicate.

Lastly, **I think writing has the ability to be very clear**. Now, I admit these are some pretty loose arguments, especially this one. It's true, poetry can be really fucking confusing. I've read Robert Frosts poems before. But with prose I can be very deliberate so I'm not too confusing. With the Mona Lisa, people are still arguing if the lady is smiling or not. I can just tell you straight up, no that bitch is smirking.

I want to end on noting that I do not believe writing is the ultimate form of expression. I think there are so many times where drawing a picture, a comic, or even a meme can better communicate something. Even a voice recording carries the nuances of tone and depth of voice. My goal is simply to show its relevance. Writing is a way to connect with others and even connect with past versions of your self. It's a way for me to share parts of myself in way that I enjoy. And a way to express my thoughts in the purest way I know how.
